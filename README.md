# William Polet (student to become a dev junior)

I somebody who like to learn and help people to learn (I was a teacher before).  
I like to play video games as well (actually on Dofus there's a time limited server it's very fun ;p)  
And if you want to know more about me, just ask !
## Fun facts about me : 
1. I can solve a 3x3 Rubik's cube under 1min (maybe with a little practice, it's been a very very long time !) my PB is between 30 and 40 sec, can't remember lol.
2. I really enjoy playing video games but I don't finish half of the games I buy...  
3. If you ask me for help, I will help you with pleasure if I'm capable.
## Three things I like the most :
1. My girlfriend of course <3
2. Free time (to play video games or to do sport)
3. Learning new things !
## What I want to achieve at BeCode :
Honestly for now, I don't know. I just want to learn new thins, to change my carreer. I know that I want to do a backend developper bc frontend is not my cup of tea. Maybe I will go on JAVA, maybe not. Keep you in touch !
## The fears I might have :
NONE (just kidding, but I don't really have fears so I don't know what answer to that)
## The things I look forward too :
Just learning new things and be able to work as a developper because I like it. I don't want to do a job that I don't like. 
## Three things I value the most to work as a team :
1. Communication, the most important skill !
2. Ask for help if needed, it's never a shame to ask someone's help, the shame is to not ask and loose time and energy for nothing.
3. Explain things calmly and clearly so you will not have to repeat the same thing over ans over.
## My favorite gif :
I don't have a favorite gif, not a huge fan of gifs.  
By the way, how do you pronounce "gif" ?  
If I had to put a gif it will be this one maybe :

For those who wants to know I was looking for a gif avout my favourites games, but could not find one that I really liked, so I put one of the "Cra" Goddess for Dofus/Wakfu.
